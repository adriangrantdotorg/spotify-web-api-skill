## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have:

- A **GitHub account**
- **Git** installed on your machine
- An **AI coding assistant** that supports Agent Skills (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- **Spotify Developer credentials** (for testing)
- Basic knowledge of **Markdown** (for documentation)
- Familiarity with **Python/JavaScript** (for code examples)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button

2. **Clone your fork locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adriangrantdotorg/spotify-web-api-skill.git
   cd spotify-web-api-skill
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/spotify-web-api-skill.git
   ```

4. **Install the skill in your local environment** (choose your platform):
   ```bash
   # For Claude Code
   ln -s $(pwd) ~/.claude/skills/spotify-web-api
   
   # For OpenCode
   ln -s $(pwd) ~/.config/opencode/skills/spotify-web-api
   
   # For Cursor
   ln -s $(pwd) .cursor/skills/spotify-web-api
   ```

5. **Create a test project** to validate your changes:
   ```bash
   mkdir test-integration
   cd test-integration
   # Test your changes by asking your AI agent to use the skill
   ```

## 📝 Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
# Update your main branch first
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test additions or improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

Examples:
- `feature/add-playlist-management-pattern`
- `fix/rate-limit-header-parsing`
- `docs/improve-installation-instructions`

### 2. Make Your Changes

#### Updating the Skill Definition (SKILL.md)

The `SKILL.md` file is the core of the skill. When modifying it:

- ✅ Keep instructions clear and actionable
- ✅ Include code examples with comments
- ✅ Follow the existing structure and formatting
- ✅ Test with your AI agent to ensure instructions work as intended
- ✅ Use consistent markdown formatting

**Example of a good addition:**

```markdown
## 6. Playlist Management Best Practices

### Batch Operations
When adding multiple tracks to a playlist, use batch operations to minimize API calls.

**Before (Inefficient):**
```python
for track_uri in track_uris:
    sp.playlist_add_items(playlist_id, [track_uri])  # Multiple API calls
```

**After (Optimized):**
```python
# Add up to 100 tracks per request
sp.playlist_add_items(playlist_id, track_uris)  # Single API call
```
```

#### Adding Examples

When contributing examples to the `examples/` directory:

1. **Create a descriptive folder name**: `examples/your-example-name/`
2. **Include a README.md** explaining what the example demonstrates
3. **Provide complete, runnable code** with all dependencies listed
4. **Add comments** explaining key concepts
5. **Include environment variable templates** (e.g., `.env.example`)

**Example structure:**
```
examples/
└── react-polling-dashboard/
    ├── README.md                # What this example demonstrates
    ├── package.json             # Dependencies
    ├── .env.example             # Environment variable template
    ├── src/
    │   ├── App.jsx              # Main application
    │   └── hooks/
    │       └── useSpotify.js    # Custom hook with rate limiting
    └── public/
        └── index.html
```

#### Writing Tests

If adding tests to `tests/`:

- Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external API calls to Spotify
- Document any setup requirements

### 3. Test Your Changes

Before submitting, ensure:

- ✅ **The skill works with your AI agent** - Install locally and test with real prompts
- ✅ **Examples run successfully** - Test all code examples
- ✅ **Documentation is accurate** - No broken links or outdated information
- ✅ **Markdown renders correctly** - Preview on GitHub or locally
- ✅ **Tests pass** (if applicable)

**Testing with your AI agent:**

```
# Ask your agent:
"Use the Spotify Web API skill to create a dashboard that polls my currently playing track"

# Verify the agent:
- Uses proper rate limit handling
- Implements the Page Visibility API pattern
- Sets appropriate polling intervals
- Extracts Retry-After headers
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "Add: playlist batch operations pattern to SKILL.md"
git commit -m "Fix: rate limit header parsing in Python example"
git commit -m "Docs: clarify OAuth scope requirements"

# Bad commit messages
git commit -m "update"
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "changes"
```

**Commit message format:**
```
<Type>: <Short description (50 chars max)>

<Optional detailed explanation (if needed)>
```

**Types:**
- `Add:` - New features, examples, or documentation
- `Fix:` - Bug fixes
- `Update:` - Updates to existing content
- `Remove:` - Removal of deprecated content
- `Docs:` - Documentation-only changes
- `Test:` - Test additions or improvements

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then, on GitHub:

1. Navigate to your fork
2. Click **"New Pull Request"**
3. Select your feature branch
4. Fill out the PR template (see below)
5. Click **"Create Pull Request"**

## 💅 Code Style Guidelines

### SKILL.md Formatting

- Use `##` for main sections, `###` for subsections
- Keep line length reasonable (80-100 characters for prose)
- Use code fences with language identifiers: ` ```python `, ` ```javascript `
- Add comments to code examples
- Use **bold** for emphasis on critical points
- Use `inline code` for variable names, functions, and short code snippets

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter standard)

**Example:**
```python
def handle_rate_limit(exception: spotipy.exceptions.SpotifyException) -> int:
    """
    Extract the Retry-After value from a Spotify 429 response.
    
    Args:
        exception: The SpotifyException with HTTP 429 status
        
    Returns:
        int: Seconds to wait before retrying (default: 5)
    """
    if exception.http_status == 429:
        return int(exception.headers.get('Retry-After', 5))
    return 5
```

### JavaScript Code Style

- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Format with Prettier (2 spaces, single quotes)

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
 * Adjusts polling interval based on page visibility
 * @param {boolean} isVisible - Whether the page is currently visible
 * @returns {number} Polling interval in milliseconds
 */
const getPollInterval = (isVisible) => {
  return isVisible ? 10000 : 60000; // 10s active, 60s hidden
};
```
